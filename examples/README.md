# Calculation examples

Storing output files for all supported calculations can dramatically increase this repository size.
We have moved these calculations to a [reptar data repository](https://github.com/oasci/reptar-data).

These files are required for tests, so you need to clone that data repository into this directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oasci/reptar-data
```

The `reptar-data` directory will not be tracked.
