============
Contributing
============

Reptar was designed to be easily expanded to support other research involving:

- parsing of other packages;
- export/writing to other formats;
- or helpful routines.

We welcome all contributions, and they are greatly appreciated!
Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given.



Types of contributions
======================

Report bugs
-----------

Report bugs at https://github.com/oasci/reptar/issues.

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

- Your operating system name and version.
- Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
- Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

Fix bugs
--------

Look through the `GitHub issues <https://github.com/oasci/reptar/issues>`__ for bugs.
Anything tagged with ``bug`` and ``help wanted`` is open to whoever wants to implement it.

Implement features
------------------

Look through the `GitHub issues <https://github.com/oasci/reptar/issues>`__ for features.
Anything tagged with ``enhancement`` and ``help wanted`` is open to whoever wants to implement it.

Write documentation
-------------------

Reptar could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official reptar docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such.

Propose a new feature
---------------------

The best way to propose a new feature is by starting a discussion at https://github.com/oasci/reptar/discussions.

- Create a discussion in the |:bulb:| Ideas category.
- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :)



Discussions
===========

If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or criticisms please start a `discussion <https://github.com/oasci/reptar/discussions>`__ so we can improve reptar!


*Black* style
=============

We use the `Black style <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`__ in reptar.
This lets you focus on writing code and hand over formatting control to *Black*.
You should periodically run *Black* when changing any Python code in reptar.
Installing *Black* can be done with ``pip install black`` and then ran with the following command while in the repository root directory.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ black ./
    All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
    58 files left unchanged.


Pylint
======

`Pylint <https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/stable/>`__ is used to lint all new Python code introduced into reptar.
You can install Pylint with ``pip install pylint`` and locally check reptar by running ``pylint --rcfile=.pylintrc reptar`` in the repository root.
All messages need to be corrected before merging into reptar.

Sometimes the Pylint suggestion does not make sense or cannot be fixed.
In these situations, you can tell Pylint to ignore that message with something like ``# pylint: disable-next=too-many-branches``.
Use this responsibly. 



Get Started!
============

Ready to contribute?
Here's how to set up ``reptar`` for local development.

1. Fork the `reptar repo on GitHub <https://github.com/oasci/reptar>`__.
2. Clone your fork locally.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/reptar.git

3. Install your local copy.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd reptar/
    $ pip install .

4. Create a branch for local development.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-branch

Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the tests.

Because parsing is a large part of reptar, we have stored the large output files in a separate `GitHub repo <https://github.com/oasci/reptar-data>`__.
The ``tests/`` is setup to search for files in the ``examples/reptar-data/`` directory.
So, to properly set this up you need to clone this repo into your local repo.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd examples
    $ clone https://github.com/oasci/reptar-data

Files in ``examples/reptar-data/``, and changes made to it, are not tracked by reptar.
Then, while in the repo root directory, you can run all of the tests with the ``pytest`` command (after running ``pip install .``).

.. code-block:: bash

.. hint::

    We run all of the ``creator`` tests first to build the required files for other tests.
    If one of these fail, it will likely cause others to fail as well.
    Always debug these first.

.. attention::

    If you are implementing new parsers or calculation types you need to include output files for your tests.
    Locally, you can store the files in your cloned ``reptar-data`` directory and run tests that way.
    Once you are ready for merge your changes, you need to add new data to ``reptar-data`` by forking and creating a `pull request <https://github.com/oasci/reptar-data>`__.
    If you need any help doing this, please search the `discussions <https://github.com/oasci/reptar/discussions>`__ or start a new one. 

6. Write any additional documentation in ``docs/source/``.
You can easily build and view the documentation locally by running the ``docs/branch-build-docs.sh`` script then opening ``docs/html/index.html`` in your favorite browser.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ./docs/branch-build-docs.sh

    The HTML pages are in html.

7. Add a description of the changes in the ``CHANGELOG.md``.
Please follow the general format specified `here <https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/>`__.

8. If any changes are made to definitions, be sure to run the ``docs/convert_definitions.py`` script to update the Sphinx documentation pages.
This script is also called in ``docs/branch-build-docs.sh``.

9. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-branch

10. Submit a pull request through the `GitHub website <https://github.com/oasci/reptar>`__.



Pull Request Guidelines
=======================

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated.
   Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the feature to the list in ``CHANGELOG.md``.

.. tip::

    You can open a draft pull request first to check that GitHub actions pass for all supported Python versions.


Deploying
=========

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy.
Make sure you have the most recent tags by running ``git fetch --tags --all``.

Our versions are manged with `versioneer <https://github.com/python-versioneer/python-versioneer>`__.
This primarily relies on tags and distance from the most recent tag.
Creating a new version is automated with ``bump2version`` (which can be installed with ``pip install bump2version``) and controlled with ``.bumpversion.cfg``.
Then, the `Upload Python Package <https://github.com/oasci/reptar/actions/workflows/python-publish.yml>`__ GitHub Action will take care of deploying to PyPI.

.. note::

    Each push to ``main`` will trigger a TestPyPI deployment `here <https://test.pypi.org/project/reptar/>`__.
    Tags will trigger a PyPI deployment `here <https://pypi.org/project/reptar/>`__.

Create a new version of ``reptar`` by running the following command while in the repository root.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bump2version patch # possible: major / minor / patch

Push the commit and tags.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git push --follow-tags

Then, create a new release on `GitHub <https://github.com/oasci/reptar/releases>`__.
